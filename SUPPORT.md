## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: The app shows "0%" or no data**
**A:** This usually means authentication failed. Try:
- Double-check your email, password, and VIN in Settings
- Ensure your Polestar account is active and working
- Wait 1-2 minutes after saving settings for data to load

### **Q: Where do I find my VIN number?**
**A:** Your VIN can be found:
- In your Polestar app
- On your vehicle registration documents
- On the dashboard near the windshield
- In your Polestar account online

### **Q: The app isn't updating my vehicle data**
**A:** Voltstar updates every 5 minutes automatically. If data seems stale:
- Check your internet connection
- Restart the app (quit and relaunch)
- Re-enter your credentials if the issue persists

### **Q: Can I change what shows in the menu bar?**
**A:** Yes! Click the menu bar icon → Settings → Status Bar Display, then choose:

**A:** If Voltstar disappears from your menu bar:
